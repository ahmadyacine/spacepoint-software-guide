                <p class="mb-4">The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a robust communication standard designed for high-reliability applications, allowing microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other without a host computer. Originally developed for the automotive industry to reduce wiring harness weight and complexity, it is now widely used in industrial automation and aerospace (like satellites!).</p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-purple-300 mb-2">How It Works</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3 text-sm text-gray-300">CAN uses a broadcast message system where data is transmitted to all devices on the network. There is no central master; any node can transmit when the bus is free.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-300">
                        <li><strong>Differential Signaling:</strong> Uses two wires, CAN High (CANH) and CAN Low (CANL). The receiver looks at the voltage difference (Vdiff = CANH - CANL), making it highly resistant to electromagnetic interference (EMI).</li>
                        <li><strong>Message ID & Arbitration:</strong> Every message has a unique ID (Standard 11-bit or Extended 29-bit). If two nodes transmit simultaneously, the one with the lower ID (higher priority) wins, and the other waits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Termination:</strong> To prevent signal reflection, the bus must be terminated with 120Ω resistors at both ends of the main line.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error Checking:</strong> CAN has built-in CRC checking and error confinement. Faulty nodes automatically switch off to prevent jamming the bus.</li>

                <p class="mb-4">UART is a simple, peer-to-peer serial communication protocol. It is "asynchronous," meaning there is no shared clock signal wire between the two devices. Instead, both sides must agree on a timing speed, known as the <strong>Baud Rate</strong>, before communication applies.</p>

                        <li><strong>Wiring:</strong> Requires two data lines: TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive). Ground must also be shared.</li>
                        <li><strong>Connection Rule:</strong> Crossover is required! Connect Device A's TX to Device B's RX, and vice-versa.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Frame:</strong> Data is sent in packets, usually starting with a Start Bit (low), followed by 5-9 data bits (usually 8), a Parity Bit (optional), and 1 or 2 Stop Bits (high).</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Commonly used for debugging (printing to Serial Monitor), GPS modules, and Bluetooth modules.</li>

                        <li><strong>Addressing:</strong> Every slave device has a unique 7-bit (or 10-bit) address. The master initiates communication by sending the target address. Only the device with that address responds.</li>

                        <li><strong>MISO (Master In Slave Out):</strong> Data sent from Slave to Master.</li>
                        <li><strong>CS/SS (Chip Select / Slave Select):</strong> A separate line for each slave device. The Master pulls this line LOW to activate a specific slave. This differs from I2C, which uses addresses.</li>
